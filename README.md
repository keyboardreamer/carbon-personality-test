# carbon-personality-test


Hello, I'm happy that you found this introduction, now I will introduce this game for you.
1. This is a game created by Naffis. The purpose of this game is to calculate carbon footprint and to solve the enviroment problem using gamification
2. The concept of this game is to conbine personality test with carbon footprint. I wish I could use this fun little program to motivate more people to reduce their carbon footprint
3. I am still a beginner so if you have any advice (from design aspect or technical aspect), please tell me using my email stu26.jhtang.jb@fairview.edu.my
